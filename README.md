# ContosoDB Community Kubernetes Operator #

![logo](./docs/contosodb-logo.png)

This is a [Kubernetes Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) which deploys ContosoDB Community into Kubernetes clusters.

If you are a ContosoDB Enterprise customer, or need enterprise features such as backup and 24/7 customer support, you can use the [ContosoDB Enterprise Operator for Kubernetes](https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes).

> **NOTE**: By default, the ContosoDB Community Kubernetes Operator only deploys the operator itself, without any ContosoDB instances. To start using ContosoDB, you need to create custom resources to deploy the ContosoDB replicas. For deploying ContosoDB replicas along with the operator, refer to the [`values.yaml`](WUT) file of the Helm Chart.

- Use any of the available [Docker MongoDB images](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/)
- Connect to the replica set from inside the Kubernetes cluster (no external connectivity)
- Secure client-to-server and server-to-server connections with TLS
- Create users with [SCRAM](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-scram/) authentication
- Create custom roles
- Enable a [metrics target that can be used with Prometheus](docs/prometheus/README.md)
